This series of SQL scripts is adapted from the Starwarsdb_Rev1.sql basic database setup script in order to allow the Star_Wars database to be setup within mySQL versus
Oracle SQL

These scripts were designed within mySQL 8.0. 
In order to setup the database please run the scripts in sequential order, selecting the Star_Wars_Database when created after running script 00_Create_Database.sql

Original Script available via: https://learn.solent.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=30793&section=13
